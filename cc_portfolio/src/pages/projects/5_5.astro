    description: `5.5 transforms artificial light into sound. When viewers put on the
                headset and headphones, they hear a mixture of electromagnetic
                disturbances caused by the artificial light sources in the room. 5.5
                invites you to an ambient synaesthetic experience. The apparatus
                becomes an artificial sensory organ: follow the white noise, let your
                ears guide you, and experience the space anews`,

Cagdas Cecen is a Vienna based media artist. He studied Media Art : 
Digital Art at University of Applied Arts Vienna and Physics at University  of Vienna. 
Currently, his artistic practices focuses in the relationship between 
human movement, space and uncertainity. Since 2018 he is developing 
new ways of interaction between human and space by using synesthetic 
nature of Quantum Physics not just symbolic or inspirational way 
but as an active element in his artworks. He strongly believes that 
democratization of Quantum Physics will open new artistic ways 
to reexplore our surroundings and improving our synesthetic sensation. 
His projects have been already presented in several countries: 
Austria, Italy, Poland, Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
