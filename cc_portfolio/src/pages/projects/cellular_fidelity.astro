    description: `The Cellular Fidelity creates a three-dimensional aquarium that breaks its boundaries using 
    light and sound. Audio is encoded into lasers that project through microscopic aquatic
                            environments into the gallery space. On the floor is a cast, colorful view of what, in reality, is
                            floating tiny and suspended above the visitors' heads. The laser reveals its sound when a
                            visitor steps into the shared aquatic space holding a sensor. Field recordings from the
                            collection sites of 30 groups of marine microbes fill the space- bending, humming, and
                            distorting with the visitor's movement. But the audio changes without a visitor, as well.
                            Because the audio-encoded laser first travels through the microbes' environment, they are
                            the first beings to make contact with it. When a cellular shape 'runs' across the floor, the
                            audio reshapes in response to the actual microbe's interaction with the laser up above,
                            picking up movement from above and making it visible and audible from below. The
                            potential for interaction permeates this whole work. That is, interaction exists in what is
                            visual and loud and in what is potential. If every visitor stood perfectly still, holding out their
                            sensors, they would still hear the audio change in a memorable chorus of microbial
                            decisions. You see, the microbes have shadowed spaces and,, therefore,, the option to
                            engage with the laser. Nobody is obligated to communicate in cellular Fidelity. We can't
                            talk, but we can hear each other. While one group sees, another sense. While only some
                            microbe in these water samples are capable of sensing light, many are, and several also
                            display different behaviours based on the volume and interference of sound. The microbes'
                            movements create a sound for the visitors. The visitors' movements create a sound for the
                            microbes. The light is shaped from both directions. Communication goes two ways. While
                            one group sees, another sense. While not every microbe in these water samples can sense
                            light, many are, and several also display different behaviours based on the volume and
                            interference of sound. Dead and decaying cells remain motionless while their descendants'
                            shadows distort them. Movements that would be invisible or indecipherable become visible
                            and audible. We can stay and spend time here. A traditional aquarium is a meeting point
                            that is also a boundary. We observe each other in our respective three-dimensional spaces,
                            separate and uncommunicative. Outside of the aquarium, even this limited observation is
                            fading. We are becoming more and more separated into our individual environments and
                            roles. We can only be aware of each other on special occasions or moments of severe harm.
                            Everything disconnects separate and moves on. Where is the value in being still, slow,
                            spending time to observe and be in a relationship with another, watery, silent world? In The
                            Cellular Fidelity, everyone is invited to step- or propel themselves- into a relationship of
                            mutual observation.`,

Cagdas Cecen is a Vienna based media artist. He studied Media Art : 
Digital Art at University of Applied Arts Vienna and Physics at University  of Vienna. 
Currently, his artistic practices focuses in the relationship between 
human movement, space and uncertainity. Since 2018 he is developing 
new ways of interaction between human and space by using synesthetic 
nature of Quantum Physics not just symbolic or inspirational way 
but as an active element in his artworks. He strongly believes that 
democratization of Quantum Physics will open new artistic ways 
to reexplore our surroundings and improving our synesthetic sensation. 
His projects have been already presented in several countries: 
Austria, Italy, Poland, Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
