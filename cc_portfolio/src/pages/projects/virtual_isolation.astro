    description: `Visual Isolation is a wearable interactive object with a display which
                demonstrates real-time vital readings and memories.
                Our lives are all about numbers and graphs for quite a while. Society tries to
                adopt new relation between our survival and our social interactions during
                isolation times and we still don't know what future will bring on us.
                Although human memory is highly depending on our social interactions, we
                as individuals are stuck between fear and losing social abilities.
                “Is surviving alone enough to stay human, what is left without memories
                with others ? “ - this was the question that lead me to develop this
                project`,

Cagdas Cecen is a Vienna based media artist. He studied Media Art : 
Digital Art at University of Applied Arts Vienna and Physics at University  of Vienna. 
Currently, his artistic practices focuses in the relationship between 
human movement, space and uncertainity. Since 2018 he is developing 
new ways of interaction between human and space by using synesthetic 
nature of Quantum Physics not just symbolic or inspirational way 
but as an active element in his artworks. He strongly believes that 
democratization of Quantum Physics will open new artistic ways 
to reexplore our surroundings and improving our synesthetic sensation. 
His projects have been already presented in several countries: 
Austria, Italy, Poland, Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
