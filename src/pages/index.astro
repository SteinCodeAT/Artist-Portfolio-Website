Cagdas Cecen is a Vienna based media artist. He studied Media Art : 
Digital Art at University of Applied Arts Vienna and Physics at University  of Vienna. 
Currently, his artistic practices focuses in the relationship between 
human movement, space and uncertainity. Since 2018 he is developing 
new ways of interaction between human and space by using synesthetic 
nature of Quantum Physics not just symbolic or inspirational way 
but as an active element in his artworks. He strongly believes that 
democratization of Quantum Physics will open new artistic ways 
to reexplore our surroundings and improving our synesthetic sensation. 
His projects have been already presented in several countries: 
Austria, Italy, Poland, Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina.

						laser modules.
						While the lasers are physically identical, the audio information they
						carry differs. This creates an entangled, amorphous audiovisual scape,
						lending it a patterned structure. Although the structure appears
						uniform, it reveals its synthesized nature upon interaction.
						Visitors wearing light-sensitive devices on both fists explore the layers
						of the soundscape through their body movements, as they interact with
						the linear-patterned space of laser beams. The devices on their wrists
						receive the modulated laser rays, transmitting the information to
						speakers, and making the rays audible inside the space.`

						light and sound. Audio is encoded into lasers that project through microscopic aquatic
						environments into the gallery space. On the floor is a cast, colorful view of what, in reality, is
						floating tiny and suspended above the visitors' heads. The laser reveals its sound when a
						visitor steps into the shared aquatic space holding a sensor. Field recordings from the
						collection sites of 30 groups of marine microbes fill the space- bending, humming, and
						distorting with the visitor's movement. But the audio changes without a visitor, as well.
						Because the audio-encoded laser first travels through the microbes' environment, they are
						the first beings to make contact with it. When a cellular shape 'runs' across the floor, the
						audio reshapes in response to the actual microbe's interaction with the laser up above,
						picking up movement from above and making it visible and audible from below. The
						potential for interaction permeates this whole work.`
