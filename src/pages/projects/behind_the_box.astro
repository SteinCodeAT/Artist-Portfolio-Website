                audio transmitting led arrays as backlight. Observers can also
                interact with the installation ”Behind the box” by moving the
                apparatus from the project “5.5”. In this way, they listen
                different sounds which come from box. Those sounds can be audio
                recordings from a war zone, a suicide youtuber, a make up video,
                and many other. Without any interaction installation stays silent.
                Visuals and movements on screen are working on Unity Engine .
                Translucent lcd creates an augmented reality feeling depending on
                the angle when observer looks inside the box. Apparatus is
                functioning just as receiver and amplifier, it does not alter anything.
                Audio cables from both Apparatus are connected to camera's
                microphone input for this presentation. What observers hear is the
                audio mapped led arrays and when they move around with the
                apparatus, they hear mixtures of mapped sounds`,

Cagdas Cecen is a Vienna based media artist. He studied Media Art : 
Digital Art at University of Applied Arts Vienna and Physics at University  of Vienna. 
Currently, his artistic practices focuses in the relationship between 
human movement, space and uncertainity. Since 2018 he is developing 
new ways of interaction between human and space by using synesthetic 
nature of Quantum Physics not just symbolic or inspirational way 
but as an active element in his artworks. He strongly believes that 
democratization of Quantum Physics will open new artistic ways 
to reexplore our surroundings and improving our synesthetic sensation. 
His projects have been already presented in several countries: 
Austria, Italy, Poland, Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
