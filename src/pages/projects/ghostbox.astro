    description: `Ghostbox is a work in the medium of audio-visual experience within
                a constructed environment. It is an attempt to investigate the
                “Observer Effect” in the real world. The action takes place in a dark
                space filled with ten constantly-powered, audio-modulated, red
                laser modules.
                While the lasers are physically identical, the audio information they
                carry differs. This creates an entangled, amorphous audiovisual scape,
                lending it a patterned structure. Although the structure appears
                uniform, it reveals its synthesized nature upon interaction.
                Visitors wearing light-sensitive devices on both fists explore the layers
                of the soundscape through their body movements, as they interact with
                the linear-patterned space of laser beams. The devices on their wrists
                receive the modulated laser rays, transmitting the information to
                speakers, and making the rays audible inside the space`,
