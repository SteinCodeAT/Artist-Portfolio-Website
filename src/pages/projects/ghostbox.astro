    description: `Ghostbox is a work in the medium of audio-visual experience within
                a constructed environment. It is an attempt to investigate the
                “Observer Effect” in the real world. The action takes place in a dark
                space filled with ten constantly-powered, audio-modulated, red
                laser modules.
                While the lasers are physically identical, the audio information they
                carry differs. This creates an entangled, amorphous audiovisual scape,
                lending it a patterned structure. Although the structure appears
                uniform, it reveals its synthesized nature upon interaction.
                Visitors wearing light-sensitive devices on both fists explore the layers
                of the soundscape through their body movements, as they interact with
                the linear-patterned space of laser beams. The devices on their wrists
                receive the modulated laser rays, transmitting the information to
                speakers, and making the rays audible inside the space`,

Cagdas Cecen is a Vienna based media artist. He studied Media Art : 
Digital Art at University of Applied Arts Vienna and Physics at University  of Vienna. 
Currently, his artistic practices focuses in the relationship between 
human movement, space and uncertainity. Since 2018 he is developing 
new ways of interaction between human and space by using synesthetic 
nature of Quantum Physics not just symbolic or inspirational way 
but as an active element in his artworks. He strongly believes that 
democratization of Quantum Physics will open new artistic ways 
to reexplore our surroundings and improving our synesthetic sensation. 
His projects have been already presented in several countries: 
Austria, Italy, Poland, Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
