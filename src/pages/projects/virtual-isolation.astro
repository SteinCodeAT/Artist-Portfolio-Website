    description: `Visual Isolation is a wearable interactive object with a display which
                demonstrates real-time vital readings and memories.
                Our lives are all about numbers and graphs for quite a while. Society tries to
                adopt new relation between our survival and our social interactions during
                isolation times and we still don't know what future will bring on us.
                Although human memory is highly depending on our social interactions, we
                as individuals are stuck between fear and losing social abilities.
                “Is surviving alone enough to stay human, what is left without memories
                with others ? “ - this was the question that lead me to develop this
                project`,
